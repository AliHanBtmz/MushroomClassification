<h1 align='center'> Mushroom Classification</h1>
<h2> Project purpose:</h2>
<p>Project Purpose: To create a model that allows the binary classification of mushrooms as edible and poisonous.</p>

## About Dataset
This dataset is a cleaned version of the original Mushroom Dataset for Binary Classification Available at UCI Library. This dataset was cleaned using various techniques such as Modal imputation, one-hot encoding, z-score normalization, and feature selection. It contains 9 columns:

* Cap Diameter
* Cap Shape
* Gill Attachment
* Gill Color
* Stem Height
* Stem Width
* Stem Color
* Season
* Target Class - Is it edible or not?
  <p></p>
The Target Class contains two values - 0 or 1 - where 0 refers to edible and 1 refers to poisonous.
